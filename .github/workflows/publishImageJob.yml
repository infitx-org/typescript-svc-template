# Prerequisites for this action:
# - need to enable "improved container support":
#   https://docs.github.com/en/packages/guides/enabling-improved-container-support
# - need to add an access token to secrets (in this case called CR_PAT), probably good to do this
#   at organisation level. This access token needs to be a personal access token at the time of
#   writing. This works, because the organisation policy gives organisation members permission to
#   publish packages.
#   Note this outstanding issue:
#   https://github.community/t/cannot-create-pat-with-scope-write-packages-without-repo-scope/154300
# - looks like you'll need to manually make the published image public by visiting:
#   https://github.com/orgs/{{ your organisation }}/packages

# TODO: create a tag/release with the version based on the version in package.json every time a
# merge is made to master? Prevent any merges to master without a code change? (That's probably
# tricky- what to do about documentation changes etc.? Perhaps build the container image, see if
# the checksum is the same as the existing one, and prevent pushes to master that change the
# container checksum without changing the package.json version?).

# TODO:
# - delete created images from the repository when a release is deleted/unpublished?
